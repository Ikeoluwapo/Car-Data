# Car-Data
## Introduction
For this Data, I imported, cleaned and analyzed using mySQL then visualization was done using Excel and Florish.

## Dataset Overview
Name: Car Data

Format: CSV (Comma Separated Values)

Size: [1,044,007 bytes]

Columns: [Name, Year, selling_price, km_driven, fuel, seller_type, transmission, owner, mileage, engine, torque, max_power, seats]

## Skills
* Aggregate functions â€” SUM, COUNT, SUM, AVERAGE
* Data problem solving techniques
* DDL and DML
* DAX
* Power Query Editor
* Data Visualization with Power BI

## Lessons Learned
I Learned that multiple analyzing tools can be used for a single project. The goal is to analyze the data and present a nice and understandable visual.
